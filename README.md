# OSIHardDrive
Design and build a recreation of the OSI hard disk, using modern technology (like flash storage)

Goals:

1.  Learn how the OSI hard disk interface works, hardware and software
2.  Create a design that emulates the OSI hard disk


To Do:

1.  Collect info on OSI hardware design
2.  Collect info on the OSI software interface (may involve reverse engineering)
3.  Document the system interaction with the disk subsystem, commands, memory locations etc.
4.  Decide which microcontroller may work best pick to emulate the OSI HD subsystem
5.  Iterate prototypes responding to OSI commands
